I'm a developer loving coding web applications. I am currently studying computer science at Polytech Nantes.

After designing a mockup with Figma, Angular helps me coding the frontend then PHP or python take over for the backend. In addition to this; Trello and JIRA are my best friends to manager projects.

Beyond coding, teamwork, good organization and proactivity are part of my daily life.
