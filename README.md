I'm a developer loving coding web applications. I'm currently studying for a master's degree software engineering at Université des Montagnes in Bangangté(Cameroun).

After designing a mockup with Figma, ReactJS, Angular helps me coding the frontend then PHP takes over for the backend. In addition to this; Trello and JIRA are my best friends to manager projects.

Beyond coding, teamwork, good organization and proactivity are part of my daily life.
